Three
=====

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/three.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/three)

An updated [Open311 API](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2) Python wrapper
that was built to be as absolute **user-friendly** and **easy-to-use as
possible**. Many of the design decisions made will reflect these
qualities.


Installation
------------

The best way to install is through `pip`.

    pip install three


At A Glance
-----------

`Three` was made to make the differences in Open311 GeoReport
implementations completely unknown to the end user. Interacting with
service requests should be easy.

```python
>>> import three

>>> three.cities()
['boston', 'macon', 'sf', ...]

# Let's start off with Macon.
>>> three.city('macon')
>>> three.key('my_macon_api_key')

>>> three.discovery()
{'service': {'discovery': 'data'}}

>>> three.services()
{'macon': {'service': 'data'}}

>>> three.services('033')
{'033': {'service_code': 'info'}}

>>> three.requests()
{'macon': {'request': 'data'}}

>>> three.requests('123')
{'123': {'request': 'data'}}

# Now, let's switch it up to San Francisco.
>>> three.city('sf')
>>> three.key('my_sf_api_key')

>>> three.services()
{'SF': {'service': 'data'}}

>>> three.requests()
{'SF': {'request': 'data'}}

# And, finally Baltimore.
>>> three.city('baltimore')
>>> three.key('baltimore_api_key')

>>> three.services()
{'baltimore': {'service': 'data'}}

>>> three.requests()
{'baltimore': {'request': 'data'}}
```

`Three` also aims to make working with dates and result counts easier, even
though not all Open311 implementations support these features.

```python
>>> import three

>>> three.city('macon')

>>> # Let's grab requests between certain dates.
... three.requests(start='03-10-2012', end='03-17-2012')

>>> # But let's use the between parameter.
... three.requests(between=['03-10-2012', '03-17-2012'])

>>> # And, let's get all the requests! (Or, as many as possible...)
... three.requests(between=['03-10-2012', '03-17-2012'], count=100)

>>> # We could even get requests of different types between those days.
>>> requests = []
>>> dates = ['03-10-2012', '03-17-2012']
>>> requests.extend(three.requests(between=dates, count=100))
>>> requests.extend(three.requests(between=dates, count=100, status="closed"))
```


Subclassing
-----------

A `Three` class can also be imported and customized, but, for casual
users, working with the `three` module should feel effortless. Any pain
points (such as dealing with XML, required parameters, etc.) should be
abstracted away.

```python
from three import Three

class SF(Three):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SF, self).__init__()
        self.endpoint = "https://open311.sfgov.org/dev/V2/"
        self.format = "xml"
        self.jurisdiction = "sfgov.org"
```

You could then use the `SF` class just as you would an instance of
`Three`.

```python
>>> SF().services()

>>> SF().requests()
```


Settings
--------

These settings apply to the core `Three` class.

A casual user of the Open311 API, by default, should not have to work
with the `Three` class.

### API Key

If you have an Open311 API key that you always intend to use, rather
than initializing the `Three` class with it each time, you can set an
`OPEN311_API_KEY` environment variable on the command line.

    export OPEN311_API_KEY="MY_API_KEY"

Otherwise, you can initialize the class with your API key and endpoint.

    >>> from three import Three
    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov', api_key='my_api_key')


### HTTPS

By default, `Three` will configure a URL without a specified schema to
use `HTTPS`.

    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov')
    >>> t.endpoint == 'https://api.city.gov/'
    True


### Format

The default format for the `Three` wrapper is `JSON` -- although not all
[Open311 implementations support it](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2#Format_Support).
This is done mainly for easy-of-use (remember, that's the over-arching
goal of the `Three` wrapper). You can, however, specifically request to
use `XML` as your format of choice.

    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov', format='xml')
    >>> t.format == 'xml'
    True


Usage
-----

### Configure

After you've initialized your `Three` class, you can readjust its
settings with the `configure` method. You can also switch back to the
orgininal settings with the `reset` method.

    >>> from three import Three
    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov', api_key='SECRET_KEY')
    >>> t.services()
    {'service': 'data'}

    >>> t.configure('open311.sfgov.org/dev/V2/', format='xml'
    ...             api_key='SF_OPEN311_API_KEY')
    >>> t.services()
    {'SF': {'service': 'data'}}

    >>> t.configure(api_key='ANOTHER_API_KEY')
    >>> # Switch back to original settings.
    ... t.reset()


### Discovery

In order to use the [Open311 service discovery](http://wiki.open311.org/Service_Discovery),
simply invoke the `discovery` method.

    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov')
    >>> t.discovery()
    {'service': {'discovery': 'data'}}

Sometimes, however, service discovery paths differ from service and
request URL paths -- in which case you can pass the specified URL to the
`discovery` method as an argument.

    >>> t.discovery('http://another.path.gov/discovery.json')


### Services

To see the available services provided by an Open311 implementation, use
the `services` method.

    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov')
    >>> t.services()
    {'all': {'service_code': 'info'}}

You can also specify a specific service code to get information about.

    >>> t.services('033')
    {'033': {'service_code': 'info'}}


### Requests

To see available request data, use the `requests` method.

    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov')
    >>> t.requests()
    {'all': {'requests': 'data'}}

[Most Open311
implementations](http://lists.open311.org/groups/discuss/messages/topic/2y4jI0eZulj9aZTVS3JgAj)
support `page` and `page_size` parameters.

    >>> t.requests(page_size=50)
    {'total': {'of': {'50': 'requests'}}}

    >>> t.requests(page=2, page_size=50)
    {'next': {'50': 'results'}}

You can also specify a specific service code.

    >>> t.requests('123')
    {'123': {'requests': 'data'}}

Other parameters can also be passed as keyword arguments.

    >>> t.requests('456', status='open')
    {'456': {'open': {'requests': 'data'}}}


### Request

If you're looking for information on a specific Open311 request (and you
have it's service code ID), you can use the `request` method.

    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov')
    >>> t.request('12345')
    {'request': {'service_code_id': {'12345': 'data'}}}


### Post

Sometimes you might need to programmatically create a new request, which
is what the `post` method can be used for. **NOTE**: the Open311 spec
states that all POST service requests [require a valid API
key](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2#POST_Service_Request).

    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov', api_key='SECRET_KEY')
    >>> t.post('123', name='Zach Williams', address='85 2nd St',
    ...        description='New service code 123 request.',
    ...        email='zach@codeforamerica.org')
    {'new': {'request': 'created'}}


### Token

Each service request ID can be tracked with a temporary token. If you
need to find the service request ID and have the request's token, you
can use the `token` method.

    >>> t = Three('api.city.gov')
    >>> t.token('12345')
    {'service_request_id': {'for': {'token': '12345'}}}
